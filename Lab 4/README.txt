Lab 4 contains five folders. They are namely: 
1/ BinarySearchTree.cpp
2/ BinarySearchTree.h 
3/ LinkedList.cpp
4/ LinkedList.h
5/ Main.cpp

The Binary Search tree program gets words from a .txt file and then puts them in a binary order. After that, the program has a function to print the inserted words in an Inorder list. The main other function in the program is the Search function. It takes a data from another .txt file and checks to see if the word exist in the first inserted .txt file. 

The Linked List program is almost similar to the Binary search tree program. It inserts words from a .txt file into linked list and gets word from another .txt file to check if the inserted file contains the word. 

The main aim of the two program is to see which program is efficient and faster in handling different data and searches.
