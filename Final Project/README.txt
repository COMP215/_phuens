Minimum jumps required to reach the end of the array. 
The program finds the minimum jumps required to reach the end of the array. The value inside the array indicates the number of jumps that you can take. You can either decide to take the maximum number of steps or less depending on the next value in the array. If you are stuck at an array where the value is 0, then that means that you cannot reach the array. 

language: 
MinimmJump = {< array , array_values> | The array[0] > 0}
